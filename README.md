# Todo-App

This is a simple yet powerful Todo application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with the following features:

- **Task Creation**: Users can create new tasks as needed.
- **Task Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed once they're done.
- **Task Deletion**: Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Persistent Storage**: The application uses the browser's local storage to save tasks. This means your tasks won't disappear even if you reload the page!

This project showcases the use of basic web technologies to build a functional, user-friendly application. Feel free to explore the code.
